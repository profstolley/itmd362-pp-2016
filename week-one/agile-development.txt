# Production Problem 1: Establishing an agile development environment

## The Problem

There is no IDE for web development. You need to assemble your own. For this
class, to start, you will need three items. First, find and install at least one
plain-text editor that can handle Unicode (UTF-8) encoding, Unix-style line
endings (LF), and syntax highlighting for the three languages we’ll write most
in this class: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll need it to write out the file
for this first Production Problem. Configure your editor to default to Unicode
and Unix-style line endings, if necessary. Looking for suggestions? Hit up the
Campfire chatroom in our class Basecamp site.

Second, you will need a version control system. We will be using Git. You’ll
either want to install Git using a package manager (e.g., aptitude on Debian,
yum on CentOS, Homebrew on OS X) or compile it yourself from source. **Do not**
just download and install a binary from the Web.

You will also need at minimum to configure Git with your name and email address.
**Do not** just download and install a binary from the Web. From there, you will
need to set up and interact with your GitHub account.

Third and finally, we will be using a bunch of different developer tools built
on top of Node.js. Like Git, you should either install Node via a package
manager or compile it yourself from source. Depending on your installation
method, you might also have to install the Node Package Manager, npm.

Basecamp.

## Deliverables

You must fork this repository from GitHub to your own account, clone it to your
computer, and edit this file.

**You should must create a separate commit for each of the following steps.**
Text between backticks are commands to run in your command-line shell.

First, you need to install Git, if you don’t have it already.

1. Copy below the output from `git version`:
git version 2.1.4


2. Copy below the output from `git config --global --list`:
user.name=navrozvadsaria
user.email=nvadsari@hawk.iit.edu


You also need to set up your public/private keypair with GitHub. Once you’ve
done that, do the following:

3. Copy below the output from `ssh git@github.com`:

llocation request failed on channel 0
Hi navrozvadsaria! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.

Clone your fork of this repository. Then, on your computer, add a remote
referencing my copy of the repository as the upstream rep by running
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/karlstolley/itmd362-pp.git`

4. Copy below the output from `git remote -v` from within your copy of this
repository:

rigin	https://github.com/navrozvadsaria/itmd362-pp.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/navrozvadsaria/itmd362-pp.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/karlstolley/itmd362-pp.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/karlstolley/itmd362-pp.git (push)


Next, you need to install Node.js, and possibly also npm, if you don’t have it
already.

5. Copy below the output from `node -v`:

v0.10.25

6. Copy below all of the output from `npm install http-server -g`:
/usr/local/bin/http-server -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
/usr/local/bin/hs -> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server
